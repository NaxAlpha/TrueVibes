# TrueVibes User Flows

## Current User Flows

As TrueVibes is in its initial development stage with only the Flutter counter demo implemented, there is only one basic user flow currently available:

### Counter Interaction Flow

1. **Application Launch**
   - User launches the TrueVibes application
   - App displays the counter home screen with counter value set to 0

2. **Counter Increment**
   - User taps the "+" floating action button
   - App increments the counter value
   - UI updates to display the new counter value
